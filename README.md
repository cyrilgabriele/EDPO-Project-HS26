CryptoFlow is a multi-service crypto portfolio simulation platform built with Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Camunda 8. It demonstrates event-driven architecture patterns including event-carried state transfer, process orchestration, sagas with compensation, and the outbox pattern.

## Services

| Module | Port | Responsibility |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `shared-events` | — | Shared Kafka event records (Maven dependency) |
| `market-data-service` | `8081` | Subscribes to Binance WebSocket streams, publishes `crypto.price.raw` |
| `market-order-scout-service` | `8086` | Consumes `crypto.scout.raw`, derives Market Scout ask quotes, ask opportunities, and window summaries |
| `market-partial-book-ingestion-service` | `8087` | Subscribes to Binance USD-M partial book depth streams, publishes `crypto.scout.raw` |
| `portfolio-service` | `8082` | Maintains a local price cache, stores holdings, exposes read APIs |
| `transaction-service` | `8083` | Runs the place-order BPMN, matches orders, publishes `transaction.order.approved` |
| `user-service` | `8084` | Stores users and confirmation links, handles onboarding compensation |
| `onboarding-service` | `8085` | Deploys `userOnboarding.bpmn` to Camunda 8 |

## Deploying the stack

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Java | 21 |
| Maven | 3.9+ |
| Docker / Docker Compose | any recent version |
| Camunda 8 SaaS | required for onboarding and order workflows |

### 1. Create your `.env` file

The compose stack reads Camunda credentials and other secrets from `docker/.env`. Copy the example and fill in your values:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# fill in the CAMUNDA_* values for each service
```

The example file documents every variable. The four Camunda-connected services (`portfolio-service`, `transaction-service`, `user-service`, `onboarding-service`) each need their own client ID, secret, cluster ID, and region.

### 2. Start the stack

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts all services and the supporting infrastructure:

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Kafka broker | `localhost:9092` |
| Kafka UI | `http://localhost:8080` |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` |
| pgAdmin | `http://localhost:5050` |
| market-data-service | `http://localhost:8081` |
| market-order-scout-service | `http://localhost:8086` |
| market-partial-book-ingestion-service | `http://localhost:8087` |
| portfolio-service | `http://localhost:8082` |
| transaction-service | `http://localhost:8083` |
| user-service | `http://localhost:8084` |
| onboarding-service | `http://localhost:8085` |

Three per-service databases (`user_service_db`, `portfolio_service_db`, `transaction_service_db`) are created automatically on first startup.
