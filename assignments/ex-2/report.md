## Issue #6 – Implement `market-data-service`

### What was implemented

A Kafka producer service that polls the Binance public REST API on a fixed schedule and publishes one price event per symbol to Kafka. The service is structured as a Maven multi-module project alongside `portfolio-service`, with a shared `shared-events` module containing the event record used by both services.

**Module layout:**

- **`shared-events`** – `CryptoPriceUpdatedEvent` record, declared as a compile-time dependency by both services
- **`market-data-service`** – the producer service itself (port 8081)

The service follows hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture:

| Layer | Package | Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound adapter | `adapter/in/scheduling` | `PricePollingScheduler` – drives the polling loop via `@Scheduled` |
| Outbound adapter | `adapter/out/binance` | `BinanceApiClient` – calls `GET /api/v3/ticker/price` via Spring `WebClient` |
| Outbound adapter | `adapter/out/kafka` | `CryptoPriceKafkaProducer` – publishes events via `KafkaTemplate` |
| Application | `application` | `PriceEventMapper` – maps `PriceTick` → `CryptoPriceUpdatedEvent` |
| Domain | `domain` | `PriceTick` record – pure domain object, no framework dependencies |

**Kafka configuration:**

- Topic `crypto.price.raw` with 3 partitions; topic `crypto.price.raw.DLT` with 1 partition, both declared as `@Bean NewTopic`
- Producer uses `acks=all` and the trading symbol (e.g. `BTCUSDT`) as the message key, guaranteeing per-symbol partition affinity and ordering
- Symbols polled: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`, `BNBUSDT`, `XRPUSDT` (configurable); polling interval: 10 s (configurable via `BINANCE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`)

**EDA pattern demonstrated – Event Notification:**
The producer emits a `CryptoPriceUpdatedEvent` per symbol on every cycle with no knowledge of, or dependency on, any consumer. New consumers can subscribe to `crypto.price.raw` without any change to this service.

## Issue #7 – Implement `portfolio-service`

### What was implemented

A Kafka consumer service that maintains a local price replica and exposes REST endpoints for portfolio and price queries. Also follows hexagonal architecture:

| Layer | Package | Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound adapter | `adapter/in/kafka` | `PriceEventConsumer` – `@KafkaListener` on `crypto.price.raw` |
| Inbound adapter | `adapter/in/web` | `PortfolioController`, `PriceController` – REST read endpoints |
| Outbound adapter | `adapter/out/persistence` | `PortfolioEntity`, `HoldingEntity`, `PortfolioRepository` (Spring Data JPA) |
| Application | `application` | `PortfolioService` – `calculateTotalValue()` via local cache |
| Domain | `domain` | `LocalPriceCache` – `ConcurrentHashMap<String, BigDecimal>` |

**Persistence:**
Flyway manages the schema with `V1__create_portfolio_tables.sql`. Two tables:

- `portfolio` – one row per user (`id`, `user_id UNIQUE`)
- `holding` – one row per `(portfolio, symbol)` pair (`quantity NUMERIC(30,18)`, `average_purchase_price NUMERIC(30,8)`, foreign key to `portfolio` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`)

**REST endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/portfolios/{userId}` | Returns portfolio with all holdings; 404 if user has no portfolio |
| `GET` | `/prices/{symbol}` | Returns cached price from `LocalPriceCache`; 503 if not yet received |
| `GET` | `/prices` | Returns full local price cache as `Map<String, BigDecimal>` |

**EDA pattern demonstrated – Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST):**
`PriceEventConsumer` updates `LocalPriceCache` on every received event. `PortfolioService.calculateTotalValue()` multiplies each holding's quantity by the cached price — no synchronous call to `market-data-service` is made at query time. The service continues to answer REST requests even when the producer is offline, at the cost of eventual consistency (prices lag by up to one polling interval).

## Issue #8 – Containerise Both Services and Complete Docker Compose Stack

### What was implemented

**Multi-stage Dockerfiles:**

1. **Build stage** (`maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21-alpine`): POMs are copied and `mvn dependency:go-offline` is run first, so the dependency layer is cached independently of source changes. Source is then copied and the fat JAR is built with `-DskipTests`.
2. **Runtime stage** (`eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine`): Only the JAR is copied into the slim JRE image. A `HEALTHCHECK` polls `/actuator/health` via `wget`.

**Docker Compose stack (`docker/docker-compose.yml`):**

| Service | Image | Port | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kafka` | `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0` | 9092 | KRaft mode; `AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE=false` |
| `kafka-ui` | `provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest` | 8080 | Monitoring dashboard |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | 5432 | Persistent volume `postgres-data` |
| `pgadmin` | `dpage/pgadmin4:latest` | 5050 | PostgreSQL GUI |
| `market-data-service` | local build | 8081 | `depends_on kafka: service_healthy` |
| `portfolio-service` | local build | 8082 | `depends_on kafka + postgres: service_healthy` |

Kafka runs in **KRaft mode**, using two listeners: `PLAINTEXT` on `kafka:29092` for inter-service communication within the Docker network, and `PLAINTEXT_HOST` on `0.0.0.0:9092` exposed to the host. Startup ordering is enforced via `condition: service_healthy` on health-checked services.
